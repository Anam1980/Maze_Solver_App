# Maze_Solver_App

* The Java application which provides the shortest solution path in a maze from start to the destination.
* It utilizes Depth Force Search (DFS) algorithm for solution path.
* The app provides Graphical User Interface for visualizing the maze and the solution.

## USAGE
* Simply, open the project in your preffered IDE.
* Launch the app by running the AppFrame class.

## ALGORITHM
* The app uses Depth-First Search algorithm to find the solution path in the maze.
* The algorithm works by exploring each possible path from the starting position until it reaches the destination. 
* If it encounters a dead end, it backtracks to the previous position and tries a different path.

## CODE STRUCTURE
The main components of the code are:

* AppFrame: The main class that provides the user interface and handles user input.
* DFS: A helper class that implements the Depth-First Search algorithm.
* Maze: A data structure that represents the maze and provides methods for manipulating it.
